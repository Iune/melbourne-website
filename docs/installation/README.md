# Installation

## Windows

Melbourne is built for Windows on a computer running a 64-bit install of Windows 10, and in theory should work with other 64-bit Windows installations. Unfortunately, as I do not own a 32-bit computer, I am currently unable to provide a version of the program for 32-bit Windows installations.

* To install Melbourne on Windows, navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/Iune/melbourne/releases) and download the `.exe` file for the latest release of the program. 
* Once the `.exe` file has downloaded on your computer, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the instructions in the installer to complete the installation process.

Melbourne should appear in the Start Menu once the installation process has completed. 

## macOS

Melbourne is built for macOS on a computer running macOS 10.15 (Catalina), and should run on other versions of macOS as well.

* To install Melbourne on macOS, navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/Iune/melbourne/releases) and download the `.dmg` file labeled for macOS for the latest release of the program. 
* Once the file has downloaded, double-click on the downloaded file. In the window that opens, drag the Melbourne icon over to the Applications folder icon â€” macOS will copy the program to the `Applications/` folder.

Melbourne should now appear in the Launchpad, and is ready to use.

# Upgrading Melbourne

Currently, the process for upgrading Melbourne is to first uninstall any existing versions of the program before installing the newer version of the program as if it was a brand new installation. 

If you've added any custom flags to the program, don't forget to back up these images first before uninstalling as they will be deleted otherwise.
